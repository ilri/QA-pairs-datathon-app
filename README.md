# QA-pairs-datathon-app
A simple Shiny/R app to gather field-specific pairs of questions and answers in a gamified way. Perfectly suited to run datathons during which Q/A pairs are crowdsourced from the participants. Questions, answers and their source references are stored in a SQLite database on the same host.
